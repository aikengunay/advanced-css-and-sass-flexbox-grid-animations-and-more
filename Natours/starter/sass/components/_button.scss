/* two types of animation:
  animation property - complex
    - The animation property is ideal for complex, multistep animations that involve more control over keyframes, timing, and behavior.
    - use this if you want to be precise about your animation for different components
    
  transition property - simple
    - use this for button state animation or simple move of components
    - The transition property is best for simple, state-based changes that occur on user interaction, like hover or focus effects.
