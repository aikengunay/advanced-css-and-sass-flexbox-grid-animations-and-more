Yes, you can use `--save-dev` when installing `sass` if you only need it as a development dependency. This is typically the case if you're using Sass to compile SCSS files into CSS during development and not in the production environment.

Hereâ€™s how to do it:

---

### **Install `sass` as a Development Dependency**

Run the following command:

```bash
npm install sass --save-dev
```

---

### **Why Use `--save-dev`?**

- **Development Dependency (`--save-dev`)**:

  - Use this if the package is only needed for development purposes, such as compiling SCSS files.
  - Example: Your projectâ€™s production build only needs the resulting CSS file, not the `sass` tool itself.

- **Production Dependency (`--save` or default)**:
  - Use this if the package is required in the production environment. This applies if `sass` is part of your runtime (e.g., dynamically compiling SCSS at runtime in a server environment).

---

### **What Happens in `package.json`?**

With `--save-dev`, `sass` will be added under `devDependencies`:

```json
"devDependencies": {
  "sass": "^1.64.2"
}
```

If you donâ€™t use `--save-dev`, it will be added under `dependencies`:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "sass": "^1.64.2"
}
```

---

### **How to Decide?**

- **Use `--save-dev`** if youâ€™re compiling SCSS into CSS as part of your build process.
- **Use `--save`** if you need `sass` during runtime (e.g., in a live application that processes SCSS on-the-fly).
